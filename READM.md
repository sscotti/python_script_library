USAGE:




1.  INSTALL the PIP module for pydicom if not already on your system:  https://github.com/pydicom/pydicom, sudo python3 -m pip install pydicom
    

2.  SET 'WORKLIST_DIR' in the script to a PATH on your system where you want to store the generated MWL file.

    cd /path/to/directoryfor/son_to_mwl.py
    python3 json_to_mwl.py
    
```
